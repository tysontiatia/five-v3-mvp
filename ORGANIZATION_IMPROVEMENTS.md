# Organization Improvements

The following organization improvements were made to optimize the project structure:

## Directory Structure Enhancements

1. **Created a Proper Theme Directory**:
   - Moved `src/theme.ts` → `src/theme/index.ts`
   - Moved `constants/colors.ts` → `src/theme/colors.ts`

2. **Organized Test Files**:
   - Created `src/test/` directory
   - Moved `SimpleApp.js` and `WebApp.js` from root into test directory

3. **Added Utilities Directory**:
   - Created `src/utils/` for helper functions

## Development Environment Improvements

1. **Linting and Formatting**:
   - Added `.eslintrc.js` for consistent code style
   - Added `.prettierrc` for consistent formatting
   - Added `.vscode/settings.json` for editor consistency

2. **Package Scripts**:
   - Added linting scripts: `lint`, `lint:fix`
   - Added formatting script: `format`
   - Added type checking script: `check-types`

3. **Documentation**:
   - Created `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` with detailed structure information
   - Updated README with simplified structure overview

## Dependency Management

1. **Development Dependencies**:
   - Added ESLint and config
   - Added Prettier for code formatting

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding:
   - Husky pre-commit hooks for enforcing linting/formatting
   - Jest configuration for testing
   - Environment variable management
   - CI/CD configuration
